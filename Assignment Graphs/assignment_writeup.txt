--APPROACH
This assignment required a python program that utilizes NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries.
The goal of this assignment is to manage graph operations using an adjacency list format including:
reading a graph from a file
writing a graph to a file
generating a random Erdős-Rényi graph
computing the shortest path between nodes
plotting a loaded/created graph

First, I started by installing the necessary libraries.
Next, I created the menu options to start testing my functions.
After, I started developing my functionalities.
Next, I created a node labeling function to help visualize the graphs. 
Finally, I began testing for edge cases, system failures, and exceptions. 


--CHALLENGES 
The biggest challenge I faced was creating a scalable node labeling generator using letters instead of the default numbers.
Additionally, testing for edge cases was a tad difficult as it was hard to imagine when the graphing operations might fail.
Finally, I made sure that the system didnt fail if a menu option was invalid.

As of right now my program can only generate a random Erdős-Rényi graph of 499 nodes. 


--ADDITIONAL FEATURES
I used letters instead of numbers when generating a random Erdős-Rényi graph.
I incorporated error handling and an interactive menu system.
