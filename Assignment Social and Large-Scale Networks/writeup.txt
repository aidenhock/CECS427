--APPROACH
I approched this assignment by first starting with understanding the requirements.
Next, I built the menu options to extend upon assignment 1 and accomadate assignment 2 functionality.
After the menu was in working order I began to implement menu operations 3b, 4b, 5b, 5c, 6a,
and finally 6b in that order. 


--CHALLENGES 
Using the dwave_networkx library was my biggest challenge, particularly with the structural_imbalance function.
This function required an annealing sampler which was the hardest part of implementation.
Other challenges included input validation, error handling, and finding time to sleep. 


--ADDITIONAL FEATURES
I decided it was unnecessary and extra work, so I did not implement, but I considered adding a dynamic
threshold function that would analyze graphs properties and calculate a threshold variable for determining 
if the assortativity coefficient is similar to the probability p based on the size of the graph and the 
desired confidence level.
